            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <hi>A ſhort Abſtract</hi> OF THE REASONS Againſt paſſing the BILL of FORFEITURES, By way of Inquiry.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>Query</hi> 1. WHether it be not reaſonable, that theſe Offenders ſhould have the ſame Benefit from the Act of Indempnity, as all other greater Offenders? Either it is, or it is not: If it be, then the Intent of this Paper is anſwer'd, which ſubmits the active Men, and thoſe who were Managers, and had profitable Places, to refund their Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to the publick Treaſury: If it be not, (as all things are moſt humbly ſubmitted to the great Judgment of the Honourable Houſe of Commons) then indeed they muſt be contented quietly to ſubmit to the Penalties due by Law. But,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Query</hi> 2. Whether any Penalties be due by Law or not? Since the ſame Law, the Ancient; Common, and Fundamental Laws of the Kingdom, which ſay, <hi>That an Act or Statute made by King, Lords and Commons, is a Law to this Nation.</hi> Doth alſo ſay, <hi>That the Judges of</hi> England <hi>are the ſole Interpreters of that Law; And that their Interpretation and Judgment, though ever ſo Erroneous in it ſelf, and contrary to the Letter of the Statute, ought not only to be obſerved, but reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renced by all inferior Subjects.</hi> And the ſame Law of <hi>England</hi> which ſays, <hi>That an Officer omitting the Oaths, ſhall forfeit</hi> 500 <abbr>l.</abbr> Doth alſo ſay, <hi>That the King may pardon that Penalty before Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation Fil'd, which is done accordingly.</hi> Therefore,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Query</hi> 3. Whether it be conſiſtent with the Goodneſs and Clemency of that Honourable Houſe, to take from them the Benefit of the Law? And to condemn ſuch a Number of Men, their Wives and Families, by a Bill of Attainder: For the Bill doth not Enact, <hi>That all Forfeitures, due by Law, ſhall be appropriated to the publick <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe; but that all Officers who were not duly qualify'd, ſhall forfeit</hi> 500 <abbr>l.</abbr> 
               <hi>right, or wrong, without a Tryal.</hi> Either the Forfeitures are due by Law, or they are not: If they are not, then this Bill amounts to an Act of Attainder: If they are due by Law, then there is no prejudice to appropriate ſuch Forfeitures only as can be recover'd by Law, which is all that is deſir'd.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Query</hi> 4. Since it is moſt evident, that this is a Bill of Attainder that doth condemn a Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Men which are not puniſhable by any Law beſides itſelf; Whether it will not introduce a Preſident of very dangerous Conſequence, that may one day or other be ſeverely uſed againſt us or our Poſterity? Though ill Men may be concerned now, yet the Caſe is the ſame, and good Men may be concern'd hereafter. What are the Laws for, but to guide and protect us? And if a Law be defective, and ill things done under Umbrage thereof, our wiſe Anceſtors have cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected the Law, and not the Offender; and that not for the ſake of the Offender, but of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and their Poſterity, that all Men may have fair warning. It is a Fundamental Rule, <hi>where
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:105560:2"/>there is no Law, there is no Offence:</hi> And therefore if this particular Act doth paſs, 'tis hoped that care ſhall be taken in this Caſe, (as it was in the Caſe of my Lord <hi>Strafford</hi>) that the ſame ſhall not be made uſe of for a Preſident againſt us, or our Poſterity hereafter. But to return,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Query</hi> 5. Why is it not reaſonable that ſome of thoſe Officers ſhould reap the Benefit of the Act of Indempnity, as well as other Offenders? Either theſe Offences are held to be greater than any other, or they are not: If they are not, then no Reaſon can be aſſigned, unleſs that which is already anſwer'd. And we cannot ſuppoſe that any perſon will maintain, <hi>That theſe Offenders are greater than Diſpenſing Judges, the Eccleſiaſtical Commiſſioners, the Quo Warranto Lords, the Surrenderers of Charters, and the Subſcribers of Addreſſes and Papers for taking off the Teſt,</hi> &amp;c. But,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Query</hi> 6. Whether the Judges at the Aſſizes did not openly declare, <hi>That all Diſſenters in any Commiſſion who did refuſe to act, ſhould be returned into the</hi> Crown-Office; <hi>For that the King had, by His Diſpenſing Power, left them utterly without Excuſe. Your Conſciences was formerly your Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe,</hi> ſay they, <hi>but now you are free from ſuch Pretences: And thoſe who refuſe to accept of the King's Favour, and to rely upon his Prerogative and Protection, ſhall be uſed as utter Enemies to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. 'Tis not for you to queſtion the judgment of the Judges; They have given Judgment, and they will maintain it.</hi> What ſhall poor ignorant Laymen do in this Caſe? They are forced, againſt their Wills, to accept of Offices of Trouble and Charge on one ſide, and their Families muſt be ruin'd for it on the other; ſo they are twice puniſh'd for the ſame Offence. When a Prince poſitively commands the Service of His Subjects, and hath the Judges of His ſide, the Subject muſt obey; and in this Caſe the Diſſenter muſt either have have hazarded their Souls, or their Eſtates. 'Tis their Misfortune to think that Unlawful, which others do not: But it is no Fault to refuſe to do a thing contrary to their Judgments. And, 'tis humbly hoped, whatever becomes of the active buſier Men, yet thoſe who bore only Offices of Trouble and Charge, as many Juſtices of Peace, who behaved themſelves well in their Stations, ſhall not be blamed for following the advice of their Council, who did aſſure them, <hi>That what Opinion ſoever they themſelves, or a Future Parliament might have of the Judgment of the Judges, yet it would certainly protect them until it was Reverſed; And therefore an acceptance of the Commiſſion was the onely way left, in that critical Juncture, to ſecure themſelves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Query</hi> 7. Whether the ſeveral Commands, Declarations and Proclamations, by Vertue, or in purſuance of the Powers and Authorities hereafter mentioned, that is to ſay, of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, <hi>Decemb.</hi> 11. of the Four Parliaments of King <hi>Charles</hi> II. 31 <hi>Decemb.</hi> 1688. of the Convention, 22d of <hi>January,</hi> of the King and Queen, 14th of <hi>February,</hi> and of the late Act for Amoving Papiſts, <hi>That all Proteſtant Juſtices</hi> (of which Few were duly quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied) <hi>ſhould proceed in the Execution of their Offices, diſarming Papiſts, ſecuring all ſuſpected or diſaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected Perſons, and preſerving the Peace of the Countrey;</hi> Be not a tacite Confirmation of their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Proceedings? For the Biſhops, the old Members of Parliament, and His Majeſty very well knew, <hi>That the Diſſenters could not receive the Sacrament, and take the Oaths, according to the Form of the Statute.</hi> And yet they expected they ſhould act; and if they had not, no doubt they would have been eſteemed by all as Enemies to the Kingdom, and ſo they would have been in the Reign of the late King, therefore there ſeems (with Submiſſion) ſome reaſon to ſhew them Favor in one Caſe, as well as in the other; there is no doubt but this acting tended to the preſervation of this Government, and that may atone, in ſome meaſure, for their acting in the laſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Query</hi> 8. Whether this Bill be deſign'd as an Expedient to raiſe more Money, and prevent Future Taxes upon the People? Or only for the Vindication of Publick Juſtice? If the latter, then the Exemplary Puniſhment of a few active Men may anſwer that Deſign in this, as well as in all other Offences: If the Former, then the New Propoſal for raiſing more Money towards the ſpeedy Reduction of <hi>Ireland</hi> by a general Tax upon all Offenders, ſeems more equal, more ſafe, and more effectual for that purpoſe. Such a general Law may be ſo penned, as to anſwer all the ſeveral Intereſts of this preſent Government: For there are three Things which ſeem to be our Intereſt at this Juncture of Time. 1. To make as many Friends as we can. 2. To diſable all our Enemies. 3. To raiſe more Money, as a Fund, to carry on the War againſt <hi>France,</hi> by ſuch a way as may prevent Future Taxes upon the People. The way to make as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Friends as we can, is to Indempnifie all thoſe Proteſtants who behaved themſelves moderately in their reſpective Stations, continued to do this Duty upon the change of the Times, for the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:105560:2"/>Service of the preſent Government, and either have already, or are willing to take the New Oaths, or a civil Teſt, and do all other ſuch Acts as ſhall be required for the Service of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. And thoſe who have been active and leading Men, and ſhall perſiſt in their Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, (thô 'tis hoped there will be but Few) yet we may conclude, that under all the long black Catalogue of Offences, there cannot remain leſs than 4000, which at 1000 <abbr>
                  <hi>l.</hi>
               </abbr> a Man, one Offence with another, will amount to Four Millions, or at 500 <abbr>
                  <hi>l.</hi>
               </abbr> will amount to Two Millions, to be levied upon Notorious Offenders, utter Enemies to the preſent Government, the Diſcovery whereof is our Happineſs, and their Puniſhment our Security; ſo that by ſuch a Bill, with a Proviſo of that Nature, we ſhall be ſure to make many Friends to diſable our Enemies, and to raiſe a very conſiderable Fund, and prevent future Taxes upon the People; and therefore we join Iſſue with the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Propoſers, and wiſh them good Succeſs in their Paper: For, in that Propoſal there is room for mercy, but here there is room for none; that is equal and juſt, this alone would ſeem unequal and partial, (ſince it is therein prov'd that thoſe other Offences are puniſhable by Law, and this is not;) that may anſwer all the Ends of Government, this can anſwer none.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Query</hi> 9. Whether it be not reaſonable, and moſt conſonant to the method of Proceedings in Parliament, that ſuch a Number <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Men ſhould have fair warning by ſome Vote or Statute, <hi>That the Judgment of Judges ſhall not be Law,</hi> before they are condemn'd and ruin'd with their whole Families? Thoſe who are guilty of buying and ſelling of Offices, have had fair warning by a Vote, and the other Offenders muſt be ſenſible of committing a Crime againſt the great Law and Cuſtom of Parliament, which is <hi>Lex Terrae,</hi> as well as the Common Law; and, it's conceived, they cannot ſo much as pretend Conſcience in the Caſe: But it's plain, that the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters had all along refuſed the Oaths, and many refuſed to act in any Commiſſion, till they were frightned with the <hi>Crown-Office</hi> on one ſide, and perſuaded by their Council on the other ſide, <hi>That the Judgment of the Judges was Law, till Reverſed:</hi> Thô it might be obſerved alſo, that the Members of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and the Reverend Biſhops and Clergy did all acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, not long ago, <hi>That they were ſorry for the late Perſecutions meerly upon the account of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and that the ſame might juſtly provoke our weak Brethren againſt us;</hi> and therefore let one Failing be ſet againſt the other, and all true Proteſtants be at length united againſt the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Enemy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Query</hi> 10. Whether there be not many true Members of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> who would be involved in ſuch a general Act of Attainder? Some having by a bare Neglect, or by Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or other extraordinary Occaſions, lapſed the time in both the late Kings Reigns. Others, who took the Oaths, hapned to go away in the Crowd, without ſigning the Declaration or Teſt. Some tendred their Certificates, and were refuſed by <hi>Popiſh</hi> Juſtices. Others have perform'd all Ceremonies, and the Records of the Seſſions are either imbezled, or loſt, by neglect of Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers. Some again, by Miſtake, have taken the Oaths in the <hi>Kings-Bench,</hi> inſtead of <hi>Chancery;</hi> and ſigned the ſhort Teſt, inſtead of the long Teſt. Others, for want of Quarter-Seſſions, have alſo incurr'd the Penalties. Theſe, and many other Caſes, may not be in every perſons preſent thoughts, and the Diſſenter is willing that others ſhould be ſaved, whatever becomes of himſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Query</hi> 11. Whether any of the late Juſtices did act like honeſt Men in their Stations? Ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they did, or they did not: If they did not, let them be ſeverel puniſhed according to Law: If they did, Where is the prejudice to the Government? O but they depended upon the King's Diſpenſing Power! What then? Were they not forc'd to it in their own Defence? They did indeed depend upon the Judgment of the Judges to be Law, and, for that Reaſon, were under no Neceſſity of complying with the late King in taking off the Teſt, as ſome will have it; No, it was not theſe Men, but the multitude of Addreſſes which deceived the Late King, and brought all thoſe late Miſeries upon us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Query</hi> 12. Whether the late Proteſtant Juſtices be Friends or Enemies to the preſent Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment? If Enemies, let them feel the Rigor of the Law: If Friends, then it is not our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt to reject or deſtroy them: No more than it would be for <hi>London-Derry</hi> that is beſieged, to deſtory a Fountain of water at one time, which, by moderate uſe, would have ſupplied the Gariſon with freſh water the whole Siege.</p>
            <pb n="4" facs="tcp:105560:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Query</hi> 13. How ſhall we do to know who are our Friends, and who are our Enemies? You may gueſs by their Religion, by their Intereſt, and by their Deportment under this Revolution; and you may alſo add, to all this, a civil Teſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Query</hi> 14. What Method then ſhall be taken to raiſe more Money? Such a Method as is conſiſtent with our Intereſt, as will not raiſe more Duſt than it will lay. Such a Method as will preſerve our Friends, and deſtroy none but Enemies; as will raiſe no Pity or Commiſeration, and, conſequently, no Averſion to the Government. Such a Method as is proper after ſo great a Revolution, and may unite all true Proteſtants at Home, againſt the Common Enemy abroad.
